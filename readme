jokesd

======

A simple C program using libcurl and libnotify that notifies you with a dad joke every 10 minutes.
The time delay, can be changed by passing the "-t" argument with the number of minutes.

The program can be compiled with the "install.sh" script, which also installs jokesd to "~/bin", and copies the the icon to "~/.local/share/icons/jokesd/"
